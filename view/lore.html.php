    <h1 class="lore-title">~Darkness upon us (with some laser beams)~</h1>
    <p>As Tristan entered the cave, seeking refuge from the darkness and all the dangers that it holds
    he couldn't help but think of what happened on that fateful day so far away.</p>
    <p>He enrolled in the army, like many young folks before him. Seeking adventure, maybe
    collecting a few imperial credits and mostly to see the vastness of the universe. Getting chicks
    was also on his mind but not the primary concern. Anyway he started as a recruit in bootcamp and slowly
    but surely going through the training until he was given a place as a deckhand on the U.S.S. Matt Dirty</p>
    <p>Months were passing by and routine gently took its place, patrols, drills, sometimes a recon mission.
    The fleet was always busy and the U.S.S. Matt Dirty being it's core was like a beehive with people running
    from one side to the other. In one of these mission they had an hostile encounter which until today
    strikes Tristan with disbelief even if he was at the core of the event. This game is not about this event.</p>
    <p>On Saturday 23 march, core planet year 3583, the U.S.S. Matt Dirty was out with the fleet on a recon
    mission.</p>

    <p><span class="hour">08:00</span> : The stardrive engines are powering on ... Gosh after 6 months aboard I still can't fathom how
    we can perform FTL jumps with such a big vessel. Technology truly is amazing.</p>
    <p><span class="hour">08:02</span> : And the jump is already done, 30 light years just like that in two minutes. That's crazy.
    Alarm are blaring now which is usual after a jump, everything is put to stress when you defy the laws of
    physics and of the universe ...</p>
    <p><span class="hour">08:10</span> : The checks have been done and everything is back to normal, I just ran accross Vincent, he told
    me there would be a game of #####crypted##### later on ... I'll probably join...</p>
    <p><span class="hour">10:25</span> : WOW what a game ! I managed to won against 5 consecutive adversaries but the last one got the best
    of me after an epic fight ! Here are the rules, it's a really ancient game and very strategic,
    every decision you make is very important. This ancient game is called Tic-Tac-Toe. You can either play
    the circles or the ixes. I myself find the ixes stronger but I guess it's just a personal opinion.
    Once you've choosed your team, you and your opponent will start putting cirlces or ixes on a 3 by 3 checkboard.
    The goal is to align vertically, horizontally or diagonally 3 of your marks before your opponent.</p>
    <h3>As the voice of Tristan's audio log fade away, you lock your eyes with your opponents. You're aware
    of the checkboard on the table between you. Slowly taking the cap of your pen, only one thing is in your head...</h3>
