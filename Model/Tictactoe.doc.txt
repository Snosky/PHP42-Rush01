The Tictactoe class is very simple yet elegant.
It contains 2 attributes that are public. For ease of access purposes.
The first is $map which contains an array with the map going from 0 to 8 and the second
is turn which contains whose turns it is (either 'x' or 'o').

The Tictactoe class contains 2 methods that you can use. The first is place($case).
It places $this->turn ('x' or 'o') to $case (0-8).
The second is checkEndCon() which checks if a player has won, or if it's a draw. You should call it
everytime a player has finished playing.
It will return 'x' if the 'x' player wins, 'o' if the 'o' player wins, true if it's a draw and false
if the game can continue.
